tank game that moves with the sticks i know it should
i want multiplayer local maybe network? hopefully 4 player
i want to make it smash bro stlye by the end of it the more damage you take the farther you fly till you go out of bounds
you drive around a tank and shoot other tanks till you knock them out of bounds the higher the damage they have taken the farther they will fly when hit with a projectile or maybe mine. should make power ups kart style jump button  so you can get right side up if you get turned over or dodge if getting shot at
need sound fx for explotions hits maybe drops movement need music thinking clasical or maybe frank sinatera style
